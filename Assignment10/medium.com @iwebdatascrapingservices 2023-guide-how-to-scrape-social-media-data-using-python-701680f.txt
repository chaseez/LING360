Let’s start with Facebook scraping.
Scrape Facebook Using Python
While starting with the Facebook data collection, the role of Facebook data scraping services is to first look into the page you want to parse. Decide which data you want to scrape, which path you want the bot to take, and the specific data selectors you require. The entire process is achieved with Facebook Pages scraper.
Let’s take the example of Tom Cruise’s Facebook public page. You will find his details, links to other pages, posts, and other media. All this data is easily scrapable. However, you must first inspect the page to scrape data from Facebook posts.
After locating the selectors, start writing the scraping code. Now, open the Python file and import Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas.
Mention the target page and introduce Selenium to imitate the user to avoid blocking.
Now, we will change the above text into a readable format using BeautifulSoup.
After segregating the data, structure it in a tabular form, i.e., DataFrame. The output will appear like this:
Scrape Twitter Using Python
Here, we will scrape Twitter data using the same method we did for Facebook with Twitter data scraping services. For this, we will take Tom Cruise’s Twitter page and separate a selector for the required data. The Twitter scraper will take care of the entire process.
Here, we will scrape all the Tweets text using the data-testid=tweetText attribute.
Begin with Python file creation and then use the below-mentioned code to scrape the data.
Scrape Instagram Using Python
For Instagram data scraping, we will again use Tom Cruise’s Instagram page, having content, images, and videos. You can directly scrape media URLs and alt descriptions from the pages Using Instagram scraper.
Conclusion
In this article, we have elaborated on the methods of scraping social media data using Python. We have emphasized Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram data scraping and how to use the scraped data for sentiment analysis, market research, and analyzing trends.
